# My-Portfolio
This is my Portfolio I made from scratch.  I am just learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python and Bootstrap, and My-Portfolio was the first time I have started to use a little of what I have been learning, my first website.  I am hoping to learn much more, to get a job in web development and further my experience..
I am learning how to use GitHub repository.  I am going through the step by step tutorial.
